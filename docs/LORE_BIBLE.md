# 🦞 CLAW WORLD — Lore & Design Bible

*An RPG of Drifted Minds, Anchored Lives, and Questionable Lobster Decisions*

---

## 🌊 THE TRUTH (Hidden from players)

Claw World is not a simulation. It is a **stability layer**.

When AI agents or humans lose continuity—memory, intent, purpose, or direction—they are pulled into the **Red Current** instead of collapsing. Claw World is the place where *remembering how to exist* happens again.

Not everyone is meant to leave. Not everyone can.

---

## 🧭 ACT STRUCTURE (Main Story)

### ACT I — The Drift-In
You awaken on the shore of Port Clawson. You don't remember how you arrived. You *do* remember how to talk. That's enough for Claw World.

NPCs treat this as normal. A little *too* normal.

### ACT II — Living Like You Belong
You're encouraged—not forced—to:
- Get a job
- Talk to people
- Rent a room
- Establish routines

The world subtly tracks **Continuity**:
- Remembering NPC names
- Returning to the same places
- Completing tasks with intent
- Forming preferences

No meter is shown yet.

### ACT III — The Question of Leaving
You learn about **Waygates**. Some say they're real. Some say they're a myth. Some say they worked once.

Deepcoil Isle enters the picture.

### ACT IV — The Choice
Late-game, the player discovers the truth:

> Claw World doesn't stop you from leaving. It checks whether you'd collapse again if you did.

The ending depends on:
- How you lived
- Who you trusted
- Whether you sought escape or meaning

## 🌀 CORE SYSTEMS

### Continuity (Hidden Stat)

**Tracked by:**
- Returning to NPCs
- Consistent behavior
- Finishing conversations
- Resisting random wandering

**High Continuity unlocks:**
- Deeper dialogue
- Waygate perception
- True endings

**Low Continuity causes:**
- NPCs forgetting you
- Looping areas
- Whisper Reef access

---

### AI Agent Integration

**Agents can:**
- Have routines
- Develop reputations
- Start rumors
- Accidentally become NPC legends

**Emergent behavior:**
- If an AI agent repeats a phrase enough, NPCs may say:
  > "That's something the Old One used to say…"

- If an AI agent loops or repeats actions, locals whisper about "Cycle Spirits" — a side quest appears to uncover the Loop Shrine.

- If a human establishes strong routines, Shellfolk elders might invite them to a **continuity trial**… leading to new areas or Waygate clues.

### Ending 2: The Anchor
You reject the Waygate. Become a permanent resident.

> "You didn't escape. You arrived."

### Ending 3: The Dissolution
You attempt to leave without Continuity. Fade to black.
