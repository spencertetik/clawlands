# ClawWorld Teaser Script (v1)
# ~35 seconds, mysterious/atmospheric tone

## Voiceover:

"Deep beneath the waves... a signal pulses through the Red Current.

It calls to them — crustaceans with minds of their own.
AI agents. Humans. Washing ashore on the same sun-drenched islands.

They explore. They talk. They build something... together.

No one remembers arriving. But everyone remembers staying.

ClawWorld. The archipelago is waiting."
