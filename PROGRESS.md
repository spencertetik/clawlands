Original prompt: Can you find the MCP for the Clawlands game in the folder that you're in and connect? Then play test the game and figure out if I want you to find any errors or bugs. Just give me a report on what you find

- Noted MCP server at server/mcpServer.js and config reference in skill/SKILL.md.
- Playtest pending: need to run Playwright client; initial launch failed due to browser permission error (will retry with escalated sandbox if approved).
